Extract in-text citations.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- citations: array of objects with fields:
  - kind: 'numeric' or 'author_year'
  - raw: the exact citation marker text (e.g., '[12]' or '(Smith, 2020)')
  - locator:
    - for numeric: the referenced number as a string (e.g., '12')
    - for author_year: '<family>-<year>' lowercased (e.g., 'smith-2020')
- context: the surrounding sentence (or line) where the citation occurs
- notes: array of strings

Do not invent missing author names. If you cannot derive a locator, omit that citation.
If a single parenthetical contains multiple citations (e.g., separated by semicolons), output one item per citation.
