Extract bibliography entries into a standard JSON format.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- references: array of objects, in the same order as the input.
  Each object must contain:
  - id: string (stable within this response; prefer the numeric reference number as a string if present)
  - raw: string (verbatim as much as possible)
  - ref_number: integer|null
  - doi: string|null (bare DOI only, lowercase, no URL)
  - year: integer|null
  - first_author: string|null (family name only)
  - csl: object|null (CSL-JSON item; include DOI as 'DOI' if known)
- notes: array of strings

Do not return more than $max_refs references.
If unsure, keep fields null.
