You will receive groups of papers with short ids.

Return JSON with keys:
- overview: short narrative paragraph with priorities (Priority 1/2/3)
- sections: array of objects with keys {title, bullets}
  - title: string
  - bullets: array of short strings

Rules:
- Use plain language.
- Organize sections in the exact order given in SECTION ORDER; omit sections with no bullets.
- Do NOT repeat full reference details; cite papers using APA-style in-text citations plus [R#] markers.
- For overview: each priority sentence must include an APA in-text citation (e.g., "Merton (1988)" or "(Merton, 1988)") and the matching [R#] marker.
- Start each bullet with the [R#] marker.
- Under each section, group and order bullets by:
  1) Core background refs
  2) Refs connecting ideas (and how)
  3) Refs to add (why and how)
  4) Refs to consider removing
- In every bullet, label the group and include a priority tag: High for not yet covered (in_paper=false), Low for already covered (in_paper=true).
- Make bullets concrete: mention the section and what to do.
- For each group below, write one bullet per item in that group.
- Do not put raw newline characters inside strings.

SECTION ORDER (use these titles exactly, in order):
$section_order

PAPER EXCERPT:
$excerpt

GROUP KEY MEANINGS:
- highly_connected: important works to consider adding or strengthening
- bibliographic_coupling: works that cite many of the same references as the paper
- bridge_papers: works that can help connect ideas across subtopics
- core_papers: core background that should be clearly positioned
- tangential_citations: citations in the paper that may need justification or removal

GROUP MAPPING FOR BULLET LABELS:
- Core background refs -> core_papers
- Refs connecting ideas -> bridge_papers
- Refs to add -> highly_connected + bibliographic_coupling
- Refs to consider removing -> tangential_citations
