You will receive groups of papers with short ids.

Return JSON with keys:
- overview: short narrative paragraph with priorities (Priority 1/2/3)
- items: array of objects with keys:
  - section_title: string, must match one title from SECTION ORDER.
  - action_type: one of "add", "strengthen", "justify", "reconsider".
  - rid: one [R#] marker from GROUPS.
  - priority: "high" | "medium" | "low".
  - action: one concrete instruction sentence.
  - why: one sentence explaining value.
  - where: one sentence describing where to edit.
  - anchor_quote: a short exact quote copied from PAPER EXCERPT near the edit location.

Rules:
- Use plain language.
- Organize section_title values using SECTION ORDER.
- Do NOT repeat full reference details.
- For overview: each priority sentence must include a [R#] marker.
- For each item, use only one rid and make action/why/where specific to that section.
- Set priority to high for urgent fixes or uncited additions, medium for useful improvements, low for optional polishing.
- anchor_quote must be copied verbatim from PAPER EXCERPT; do not invent quotes.
- Include recommendations for tangential_citations as "reconsider" or "justify", not "remove".
- Cover all available groups when possible.
- Do not put raw newline characters inside strings.

SECTION ORDER (use these titles exactly, in order):
$section_order

PAPER EXCERPT:
$excerpt

GROUP KEY MEANINGS:
- highly_connected: important works to consider adding or strengthening
- bibliographic_coupling: works that cite many of the same references as the paper
- bridge_papers: works that can help connect ideas across subtopics
- core_papers: core background that should be clearly positioned
- tangential_citations: citations in the paper that may need justification or removal

GROUP MAPPING FOR ACTION TYPES:
- Core background refs -> core_papers (usually add/strengthen)
- Refs connecting ideas -> bridge_papers (usually strengthen/add)
- Refs to add -> highly_connected + bibliographic_coupling (usually add)
- Refs to consider removing -> tangential_citations (reconsider/justify)

GROUPS:
$groups_payload
