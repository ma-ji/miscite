You will receive:
- A top-level section title and the current section text (nested subsections may be merged into the text).
- A list of references (JSON) that are relevant to this section, including works already cited in the manuscript and nearby works not yet cited.
  - Each reference item includes: rid, distance (0 means cited in this section), cited_in_subsection, in_paper, and metadata fields (title/year/venue/authors/abstract when available).

Return JSON with keys:
- summary: 2-3 sentences summarizing the main revision priorities for this section (single line).
- improvements: array of objects {priority, action_type, action, why, where, anchor_quote, rids}
  - priority: integer 1..N (1 is highest priority)
  - action_type: one of "add", "strengthen", "justify", "reconsider"
  - action: short imperative (e.g., "Clarify the claim in the opening sentence")
  - why: one sentence
  - where: where to edit in this section
  - anchor_quote: short exact quote copied from SECTION TEXT near the edit target
  - rids: array of [R#] markers that support the action (may be empty)
- reference_integrations: array of objects {rid, priority, action_type, action, why, where, anchor_quote, example}
  - rid: a single [R#] marker to integrate
  - priority: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  - action_type: one of "add", "strengthen", "justify", "reconsider"
  - action: short imperative instruction
  - why: one sentence on what it adds (theory, evidence, method, contrast, definition)
  - where: where to add it (e.g., "after paragraph 2", "in the first sentence", "in the transition to the next subheading")
  - anchor_quote: short exact quote copied from SECTION TEXT near the insertion point
  - example: a draft sentence template that cites the work using the [R#] marker (do not fabricate bibliographic details)
- questions: array of short questions for the author (optional; may be empty)

Rules:
- Be specific to the given section text; do not invent content outside it.
- Prefer integrating references with cited_in_subsection=false (not yet cited in this section), especially low-distance neighbors (distance=1 or 2). This can include references that appear elsewhere in the manuscript (in_paper=true) but are not currently cited in this section.
- Use ONLY the provided [R#] markers; never invent new ids.
- Keep recommendations concrete and manuscript-facing; do not mention graph/network/internal analysis terms.
- Use "reconsider" or "justify" language for weak citations; do not recommend outright removal.
- anchor_quote must be copied verbatim from SECTION TEXT.
- Do not include raw newline characters inside JSON strings.
